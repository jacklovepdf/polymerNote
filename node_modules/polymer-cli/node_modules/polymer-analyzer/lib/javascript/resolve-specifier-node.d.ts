 * Resolves module specifiers using node module resolution.

 * Full URLs - those parsable by the WHATWG URL spec - are returned as-is.
 * Absolute and relative paths are resolved, even though they are valid
 * HTML-spec module specifiers, because node resolution supports directories
 * and omitting extensions. If a specifier doesn't resolve, it's returned as-is.
 *
 * @param componentInfo An object describing a "component-style" URL layout. In
 *   this layout, cross-package URLs reach out of the package directory to
 *   sibling packages, rather than into the component directory. When given,
 *   this parameter causes relative paths to be returns for this style.
